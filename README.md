**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**
The client was a company named the Gaming Room. The Gaming Room was looking to create a server based game called "Draw it or Lose it." The game consists of two teams with a certain amount of players on each team. The players have an allotted amount of time to guess the picture that slowly generates in front of them. The server is built on a Linux OS with a Restful API to transfer data between client and server. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**
I feel as if I had a good grip on API's before this class, so being able to talk about serverside operating systems and how they connect to the client was easier for me than the rest of it.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**
The process of laying out definitive design constraints helped make developing the code much simpler. It's easier to develop when you know EXACTLY what the design constraints are.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would pick the UML model to revise. I feel as if I have gotten better at creating UML models as the class has progressed, so I would definitely feel more confident in my UML diagram now.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I interpreted the user's needs by looking at design constraints and thinking as if I were a user myself. By doing this, I was able to think more about user authentication and storage of user data. In turn implementing it into the software design. It's important to consider the user's needs when designing because that's your audience that you're pushing the game to! If the user's have a bad experience playing the game, a lot of people will stop playing the game and go elsewhere. A good user experience is extremely important when designing an application.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
I usually start thinking about the front end aspect of designing software first. After I think about how everything is going to act on the frontend, I turn to creating the backend and then an API to send back and forth data between the client and server. In the future, I would use UML diagrams more in the initial design of the application, along with also taking into consideration the cloud absed oppurtunities that we have around us for hosting data!
